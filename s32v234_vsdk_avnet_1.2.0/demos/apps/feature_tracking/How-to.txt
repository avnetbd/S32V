QUICK START
==============================
To create a new project:
 1. Copy and paste this project.
 2. On the entire APPLICATION_DEMO tree, run the following find & replace:
      b)  APPLICATION_DEMO -> your_app
            This is used generally where we use your_app (e.g., file names) 
            It is also used in include guards.    

      c) gdcAd -> placeYa
         This is the short form for your application name.
         Current format:
            - development location (e.g., gdc for Gatineau Development Centre)
            - application shorthand (Ya for Your app)
      
      d) _GDC_TEMPLATE_ -> _PLACE_APP_
         PLACE is the same as above. Template is your app name
         (e.g., FACE_DETECTOR). You can also abbreviate this (e.g., FD) to
         increase readability, as many functions use this as their prefix.

3. Rename the files as shown above.

INTRODUCTION
==============================
This project functions as a skeleton. That is to say, it contains everything
needed for scheduling the two processes (process0 and process1), initializing
them, and displaying them to the screen; but if you run this project, it does
not actually do anything. It is up to you to write the code to do the actual
processing.

You have two processing tasks to work with. For example:
   process0 may be a call to apexcv::Resize
   process1 may be a call to apexcv::Hog

You need to propagate the code with everything that these require -- their
input parameters and any other processing you want to do.

In particular, there are TO USE comments scattered through this code. This
is where you need to add to the project. Some of these are optional; these
are noted as well.

In particular, attempts are made to note special project requirements: things
that you MUST do or the project will break (like making calls to ACF only when
you have the semaphore).

REFERENCE PROJECT
==============================
This project is based off of the pedestrian detector demo, which,
coincidentally, uses apexcv::Resize and apexcv::Hog. As a result,
it is a good starting point or 'reference project.'
